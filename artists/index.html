            <p class="slideP-expanded">Nova Liz is an emerging artist known for their multifaceted talents in photography and music. From a young age, they were deeply inspired by hardworking artists and their craft. Although they always aspired to immerse themselves in photography, music, and other artistic pursuits, they initially held back due to a fear of external criticism.
              <br><br>
              Nova's journey began at the age of 12 when they picked up a guitar. Despite their passion, they confined their playing to quiet moments alone at home. Their artistic aspirations took a significant turn when they moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, for two years. There, they found themselves surrounded by a community of creatives who encouraged them to take their talents seriously.
              <br><br>
              Since then, Nova Liz has flourished. They have photographed over 50 concerts and continue to add to that number. Their artistic journey has also led them to learn music production, and they dedicate themselves to playing and writing music daily.
